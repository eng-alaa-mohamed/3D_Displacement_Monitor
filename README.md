3D Displacement Monitor

The objective of this Python code is to analyze and display 3-D displacement of GNSS Rover based on Geodetic coordinates. The input is CSV file and 2 arguments which are rover serial number and masking value in millimeters. The CSV file has GNSS Geodetic coordinates and TTFF (Time to First Fix). These readings are generated by GNSS Rover every 10 minutes. The calculated 3-D displacement is in delta Cartesian coordinates i.e. delta ENU coordinates (East, North, Up). 

The user interface shows the processed filename and average TTFF 
4 graphs are plotted in one convas: displacement in 3 directions (ENU) and TTFF (Time to First Fix)      

Algorithm description:
- Discard the first 2 readings (20 minutes) as these readings are not reliable (rover is not stable yet).
- Convert the Geodetic coordinates to Cartesian coordinates 
- Consider the next 10 readings to devise the quiescent position
- For the upcoming readings, compare each reading (in each direction) to the quiescent position to come up with the displacement in mm 
- Some spikes may be witnessed due to noise, so spikes masked out is an optional argument that filter out displacement above certain limits
